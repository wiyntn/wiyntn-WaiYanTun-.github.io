			<li>The performance of a 100MHz microprocessor P is measured by executiing 10,000,000 instructions of benchmark code, which is found to take 0.25s. What are the values of CPI and MIPS for this performance experiment? Is P likely to be superscalar?</li>
			<li>Let A = A(1), A(2)),...,A(1000) and B= B(1), B(2),....,B(1000) be two vectors, that is, one-dimensional arrays of numbers to be added.The desired vector sum C = A+B is defined by C (1), C(2),....,C(1000) = A(1) + B(1), A(2) + B(2),...,A(1000) + B(1000). Write down the IAS program for this vector addition. The vectors A, B, and C are assumed to be stored sequentially, beginning at locations 1001, 2001, and 3001, respectively.<b id="right">(20 marks)</b></li>

			<li>Design a serial subtracter where the subtraccter's inputs are two unsigned binary numbers n1 and n2; the output is the difference n1-n2. Construct a state table, an excitation table, and a logic circuit that uses JK flip-flops and NOR gates only.

			<li>A certain computer system executes a stream of tasks in a manner that can be accurately modeled by an M/M/1 queueing system. The computeer is busy 75 percent of the time, and the average job spends four minutes in the computer. (a) How many jobs are in the computer on average? (b)What is the maximum rate at which jobs may arrive at the systembefore it becomes overloaded? State clearly your definition of overloaded.</li>

		<li>Design a 8-input multiplexer/data selector using two copies of 4-input multiplexer/data selector. You may use a few additional gates of any standard types in your design, if needed.
		</li>
		<li>Design at the register level a modullo-16 binary up-down counter CNTR. The counter has three function dontrol input lines: LOAD, which loads the couter with an initial value from a 4-bit external bus BUS, and COUNT, which increments or decremets the counter by one, and DOWN, where DOWN = 1, causes the counter to counter to count down (decrement) and DOWN = 0, causes the counter to count up. The available component types (sue as many of each as you need) for building CNTR are the 4-bit D register; the 4-bit adder; the two-input 4-bit multiplexer; and the two-input m-bit NAND word gate with m=1,2 and 4.

		<li>Write an assembly language program for the mutiplication operation AC:= AC x N where the multiplicand is the initial contents of the accumulator AC and the mutiplier N is a variable stored in memory. Assume that the multiplier and multiplicand are both unsigned numbers and that they are sufficiently small that hte product will fit in a single word.Use the instruction set of accumulator-based CPU shown in the Table (4-b) for the program.<br>
