  		<li>Define three instruction types and build a datapath in operation for (sub $t1, $t2, $t3) instruction.<b id="right">(10 marks)</b>
  		</li>
  		<li>In this problem we have four instructions: lad (lw), store (sw), R-type (add, sub, and or, slt) and branch (beq). Compare the average time between instuctions of a sigle-cycle implementation, in whcih all instructions take one clock cycle to a pipelined implementation. The operation times for the major functional units in this problem are 100ps for menory access, 100ps for ALU operatin and 50ps for register file read or write. Compare the average time between instructions of a single-ccle and pipelined implementation for one million load instructions.<b id="right">(10 Marks)</b></li><br>

			<li>Suppose we have a processor with a base CPI of 1.0, assuming all references hit in the primary cache, and a clock rate of 5 GHz. Assume a main memory access time of 100ns, including all the miss handling. Suppose the miss rate per instruction at the primary cache is 2%. How much faster will the processor be if we add a secondary cache that has a 5ns access time either a hit or a miss and is large enough to reduce the miss rate to main memory to 0.5%?<b id="right">(10 Marks)</b></li>
