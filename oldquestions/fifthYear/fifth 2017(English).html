<h2>QUESTION I</h2> <i><b id="right">(20 Marks)</b></i>
<br>
Read the passage and answer the following questions.<br>
<b>Private space</b>
<ol type="A">
	<li>It's a remarkable achievement: the question is no longer 'How can we send humans into space?' but 'How can we keep there?' Spaceflight is reaching a turning point where new technologies in engine development, better understanding of aerodynamics and materials for body construction are making spaceflight possible for private industry.
	</li>
	<li>The history of space exporation, until reatively recently.But the most recent launches to the International Space Station (ISS) have been very special fro at least three reasons. Firstly, along with 450 kg os scientific equipment, food and clothes, the rocket was carrying ice cream. Secondly, the rocket was unmanned, being guided into docking position and back to earth again by remote control and automated systems. Finally, the rocket was commissioned fromm a provate company by NASA.
	</li>
	<li>When the provately owned rocket delivered its goods to the ISS, it marked a milestone in the evoluation of space flight . The flight has been a long time in development. It started with President George W Bush announcing his Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the ISS to be completed. Under the next President, America's Space Shuttles were retred leaving NASA with no other choice but to look for alternative methods of supplying the ISS. This initiative was part of an effort to commercialise the investment in the indeustry across a wider group than bovernments.
	</li>
	<li>The initiative had many attractions for NASA. By outsourching to the private sector the routine business of faking fod and equipment to and from low-earth orbit, NASA can theoretically free up money to do things that it really by the 2030s. Now that the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (Space X) has proved that private enterpriese can be players in space sxploration, firms are pouring money into developing new spacecrft built to transport cargo, to maine asteroids and to carry passengers to space.
	</li>
	<li>In the last half of the twentieth century only government-backed agencies like NASA  adn Russia's ROSCOSMS were capable of running space programmes due to the gigantic that the former conditions are no longer relevant as new solutions are coming to light.Likewise, no one can predict where commercial enterporise will take the space industry.
	</li>
	<li>The uncertainty surrounding where the space industry will end up is a problems as well as an asset and it is unsettling private nvestros who like to invest in relatively certain prospects. At the moment the owner of SpaceX. In addition, the relatively small number of companies in the area could pose a problem in the future. The commercial space industry is still very new and there is no guarantee that progress will be smoother. For one thing, no one is sure that the business model is sound: government is still the major, if not only, customer availabel to the private space companies.The question is what would happen to the industry if another accident occured. Finally, many space experts are doubtful that, even if private industry takes over the 'taxi' role for low-orbit missions, NASA will be able to achieve its ambitions, given its squeezed budgets and history of being used for government and private industry. If NASA doesn't go to Mars of the asteroid betlt, its private competitors certainly have plans to do so.
	</li>
	<li>In spite of all these risks, many argue that it is critical for the private sector and federal govenment to work together to push further into space.
	</li>
