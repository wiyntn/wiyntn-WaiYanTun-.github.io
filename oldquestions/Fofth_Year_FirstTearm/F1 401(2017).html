			<li>The Primo Insurance Company is introducing two new product lines: special risk insurance and mortgages. The expected profit is $5 per unit on special risk insurance and $2 per unit on morrgages. Management wishes to establish sales quotaas for the new product lines to maximize total expected profit.

				A cargo plane has three compartments for storing cargo: front, center, and back. These compartments have capacity limits on both weight and space, as summarized below:
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Compartment</td>
						<td>Weight Capacity (Tons)</td>
						<td>Space Capacity (Cubic Feet)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Front </td>
						<td>12</td>
						<td>7,000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Center</td>
						<td>18</td>
						<td>9,000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Back</td>
						<td>10</td>
						<td>5,000</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Fourthermore, the weight of the cargo in the respective compartments must be the same proportion of that compartment's weight capacity to maintain the balance of the airplane. The following four cargoes have been offered for shipment on an upcoming flight as space is available:
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Cargo</td>
						<td>Weight(Tons)</td>
						<td>Volume(Cubic Fee/Tons)</td>
						<td>Profit($/Ton)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>20</td>
						<td>500</td>
						<td>320</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>16</td>
						<td>700</td>
						<td>400</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>25</td>
						<td>600</td>
						<td>360</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>13</td>
						<td>400</td>
						<td>290</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Any protion of these cargoes can be accepted. The objective is to determine how much (if any) of each cargo should be accepted and how to distibute each among the compartments to maximize the total profit for the flight. Formulate a linear programming model for theis problesm.

				An airplane manufacturer specializes in producing small airplanes. It has just received an order from a major corporation for 10 customized executive jet airplanes for the use of the corporation's upper mangement. The order calls for three of the airplanes to be delivered (and paid for) during the pcoming winter months (period 1), two more to be delivered during the spring (period 2), three more during the summer (period 3), and the final two during the fall (period 4).<br><br>
				Setting up the production facilities to meet the corporation's specifications for these airplanes requires a setup cost of $2 million. The manufacturer has hte  capacity to produce all 10 airplanes within a couple of months, when the winter season will b under way. However, this would necessitate holding seven of the airplanes in inventory, at a cost of $200,000 per airplane per period, until their scheduled delivery times. To reduce or eliminate these substantial holding costs, it may be worhtwhile to produce a smaller number of these airplanes now and then to repeat the setup (again incurring the cost of $2 million) in some or all of the subsequent periods to produce additional small numbers. Management would like to determine the least costly production schedule for filling this order.<br><br>
				Use the deterministic periodic-review model to determine how many airplanes to produce (if any) during the beginning of each of the four periods in order to minimize the total vaariable cost.
