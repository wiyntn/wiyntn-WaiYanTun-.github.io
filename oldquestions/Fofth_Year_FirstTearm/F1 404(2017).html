		An deucation database contains information about an inhouse company education training scheme.For each training scheme, the database contains details of all perquisite courses for that course and all offerings for that course; for each offering, it contains details of all teachers and all student enrollments for that offering. The database also contains information about employees. The relevant relvars are as follows, in outline:<br>
		COURSE {COURSE#,TITLE}<br>
		OFFERING {COURSE#,OFF#,OFFDATE,LOCATION}<br>
		TEACHER {COURSE#,OFF#,EMP#}<br>
		ENROLLMENT {COURSE#,OFF#,EMP#,GRADE}<br>
		EMPLOYEE {EMP#, ENAME,JOB}
