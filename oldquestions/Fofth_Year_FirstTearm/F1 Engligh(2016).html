	<li><b>Read the passage below and answer the following questions.<span id="right">(20 Marks)</span></b>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>The birth of manlike machine is the actualization of Automata Theory. This theory is a concept that describes how machines mimic human behavior. The theory proposes that human physical functions and behavior can be simulated  by a mechanical or computer-controlled device. Applications of automata theory have incluede imitating buman comprehension and reasoning skills using computer programs, duplicationg the function of muscles and tendons by hydraulic systems or electric motors, and reproducing sensory organs by electronic sensors such as smoke detectors.

			</li>
			<li>The conecpt of automata, or manlike machines, has historically been associated with any self-operationg machine, Such as watches or clockwork songbirds's drive by tiny spriings and gears. But in the late 20th eentury, the science of robotics which is the development of computer controlled devices that move and manipulate objects, has replaced automata as it relates to replicating motion based on human anatomy. On the other hand, modern theroies of automata currently focus on reprducing human thought patterns in addition to problem solving abilities using artificial intelligence and other advance computer science teechniques.
			</li>
			<li>
				Automata data to ancient times.In fact, the existence was found as early as the 3rd century BC in oriental Asia. During the Han dynasty a mechanical orchestra was constructed for the Chinese Emperor.In Europe, the 13th-century English philosopher and scientist Roger Bacon is credited with creating an artificial talking head, and in the 17th century French philosopher and mathematician ReneDescartes reportedly built a female automaton as a traveling companion. In the 18th and 19th centuries, intricate machines were constructed that imitated some human actions, such as limb movement. However, these devices were little more than sophisticated windup toys for children.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mimicry of human mental abilities did not begin until the advent of electronics and mathematical logic structures. In teh mid-20th century the acclaimed British mathematical Alan Turing designed a theoretical mdchine to process equations without human direction. The machine which now known as a Turing macine, in concept resembled an sutomatic typewriter that used symbols for math and logic instead of letters.Turnng intended the device to be used as a "universal machine" that could be programmed to duplicate the function of any other existing machine.Turing's machine was the theroretical precursor tp the modern digital computer.
			</li>
			<li>In the 1940s and 1950s American researchers Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts at the Massacusetts institute of Technology developed atrificial neurons, or neural networks, to theorectically bridge the structure of the human brain and the still-to-be-invented modern computer.The human brain has about one trillion herve cells, or neurons, each of which is connected to several other heurons. This allows neurons to transmit information along different pathways, depending on the stimulation they receive. McCulloch and Pitts theorized that htis same mode of information transmission, an interconnected network, might be reprocduced with electronic components. Artificial neural networks have been shown to have the capacity to learn from their experiences and enhance their computational performance.
			</li>
			<li>In 1956 Americn social scientist and Nobel laureate Hebert Simon and American physicist and computer scientist Allan Newell at Carhegie Mello University in Pennsylvania devised a program called Logic Theorist tha tsimulated human thinking on computers, although at first the program was simply written on index cards due to the scarcity of computers. Newell and Simon later created a modified wersion of te program called the General Problem Solver (GPS). The GPS was unique in that it was progrmmed to achieve a goal and then find the means to reach that goal_as opposed to starting from a problem or question and working towards an eventual solution. The GPS process involved backward thinking, going from the final solution to the present state. Using computers from the Rand Corporation to test GPS, Simon and Newell found that in some cases the General Problem Solver did act as if it were capable of human reasoning. This was one of the first breakthroughs in the computer science field that would later be known as AI or Artificial intelligence.
			</li>
			<li>
				The first Artificial Intelligent conference took place at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire in 1956.This conference developed significant results and outcomes in the field of artificial intelligence as it inspired researchers to undertake profects that emulated human behavior in the areas of reasoning, language comprehension, and communications. In addition, to Newell and Simon, computer scientists and mathematiceans Claude Shannon, Marvin Minsky
				and John McCarthy laid the groundwork for creaating "thinking" machines from computers. Contemporaty fields of interest resulting from early AI research include expert system, cellular automata, and artificial life.
			</li>
			<b>Questions 1-3</b><br>
			Describe whether the following statements are <b>TRUE, FALSE, or NOT GIVEN.</b>
			<ol>
				<li>An evidence of Automata goes back about 300years earlier before the birth of Christ.

				</li>
				<li>American social scientist Herbert Simon was awarded the Nobel prize in 1956.

		Glass, which has been <b>1.------</b> since the time of the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, is little more than a mixture <b>2.------</b> sand, soda ash and lime.

The first successful <b>5.------</b> for marking clear, flat glass involved <b>6.-----</b>. This method was very effective as the glass had not touched any surface <b>7.-----</b> being soft and becoming <b>8.-------</b>, so it stayed perfectly unblemished, with a 'fire finished'. <b>9.------,</b> the process <b>10.-------</b> a long time and was labour intensive.<br>
		Nevertheless, demand <b>11.-------</b> flat glass was very high and glassmarkers across the world were looking for a methos <b>12.------</b> marking it continuously. The first continuous ribbon process involved squeezing molten <b>13.--------</b> through two hot rollers, similar <b>14.--------</b> an old mangle. This allowed glass of virtually any <b>15.---------</b> to be made non-stop, but the rollers would leave <b>16.--------</b> sides of the glass <b>17.-------</b> and these would then <b>18.--------</b>
		to be ground and polished. This part of the <b>19.---------</b>
		rubbed away around 20 percent of the glass, and the <b>20.--------
