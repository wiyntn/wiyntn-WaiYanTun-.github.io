			Company N, a system integrator, is reviewing its testing method in order to reduce the number of bugs left uncorrected n the programs developed by the company.<br><br>
			<p><a href="" id="line">[Description of the testing method used in Company N]</a></p>
			Company N mainly tests the programs using control flow testing, which is a white box testing method.Control flow testing focuses on the smallest units that form a program, such as commands, paths, and decision conditions. Test cases and test data are prepared in accordance with the coverage criteria defined during test planning, and the behavior ot the developed programs is checked. The voverage cirteria include statement coverage where all the stateents are executed at least once in the test and decision condition coverage (granch coverage) where all the paths after all the branches are executd at least once. Company N uses only branch coverage as its coverage cirtria.<br><br>
			<p><a href="" id="line">[Description of the decision condition of branch coverage used by Company N]</a></p>
			
			A decision condition for a branch includes a single condition that evaluates only one condition, and a multiple condition that evaluates two or more single conditions combined with "and" or "or".
			When a program is executed, short-cut evaluation is applied to a multiple condition that evaluted is sequence from left to right.
