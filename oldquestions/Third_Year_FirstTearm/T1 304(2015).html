Draw a class diagram for the following description. Consider the world of companies:Companies are made up of departments and offices. Some departments can have sub departments, which are departments, but some do not have. (note: draw that desctiption without suing sub department class). Each person must be a member of exactly one department and that each department must have at least one Person as a member. Each department must have exactly one person as a manger. A manager must also be a member of the department.( Again use onl one class for both member and manger.) Add a class (PersonnelRecord) that realizes the interface called "ISecureInformation". The Person class uses the class "PersnnelRecord". Whenever the PersonnelRecord class changes, it may affect the semantics of the Person class. Assume that companies thave a name add address, while department have a dept# and a name. Person have personid and salary. Default initial value of salaty is 100000.<span id="right">(10 marks)

Draw a use diagram for a ticket distributor for a train system. The system is used by travelers, who purchase different types of tickets (BuyOneWayTicket, BuyWeeklyCard,BuyMOnthlyCrd). The other actor is a central computer system which maintains arefrence database for the tariff. There are also the following execptional cases: Time-Out (i.e, traveler took too long to insert to insert the right amount), TransactionAborted (i.e., traveler selected the cancelbutton without completing the transaction).<span id="right">(5 marks)</span>

<li>
	Draw a sequence diagram that specifies the flow of control involved in initiating a two-party phone call. There are four objects involved: two Callers (s and r), an unnamed telephone Switch, and c, the reification of the Conversation Between the two partiex The sequence begins with one Caller (s) dispatching a signal (liftReceivr) to the Weitch object. In turn, the Switch calls setDialtone on the Caller, and the Caller iterates on the message dialDigit. The Switch object then calls itself with the message uouteCall. It then creates a Conversation object (c). The conversation object then tells the Switch to conect the call, then tells both Caller objects to connect, after which tey may exchange information. <span id="right">(6 marks)</span>

<li>
	Draw an activity diagram for the following process: "Withdraw money from a bank account through an ATM".
	When the ATM machine prompts "Enter PIN", the customer enters his PIN. The bank authouizes the PIN number. If the PIN number is not valid, the ATM machine will eject card which will be taken back by the custome. If the PIN number is valid, the customer has to enter the amount of money he would like to withdraw. The bank checks the account balance. If the balance is less than amount, the ATM machine will eject card. Otherwise the transaction is continued by processing the following activities concurrently: tace money from slot by the customer and debit account by the bank. After processing both activities, the ATM machine will show balance. Then the ejected and which will be taken bak by the customer.<span id="right">(6 marks)</span>
