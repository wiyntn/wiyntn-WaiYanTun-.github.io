		<ol id="type" class="ma">
			<li><b>A</b><br>
				Gesides the earth's coeans,glacier ice is the largest source of water on earth.A glacier is a massive stream of sheet of ice that moves underneath itself under the influence of gravity.Some glaciers travel down mountains or valleys, while others spread across a large expanse of land. Heavily glaciated regions such as Greenland and Antarctica are called continental glaciers.These two ice sheets encompass more than 95 percent of the earth's glacial ice. The Greenland ice sheet is almost 10.,000 feet thick in some areas, and the weight of this glacier is so heavy that much of the region has been depressed below sea level.Smaller glaciers that occur at higher elevations ae called alpine or val/ey glaciers.Another way of classifying glaciers is in terms of their internal temperature.In temperate glaciers, the ice within the glacier is near its melting point.Polar glaciers,in contrast, alwas maintain temperatures far below melting.


			</li>
			<li>
				<b>B</b><br>
				The majority of the earth's glaciers are located near the poles,thought glaciers exist on all continents,including Africa and Oceania.The reason glaciers are generally formed in high alpine regions is that they require cold temperatures throughout the year.In these areas where there is little opportunity for summer ablation (loss of mass), snow changes to compacted fim and then crystallized ice.During periods in which melting and evaporation exceed the amount of snowfall, flaciers will retreat rather than progress. While glaciers rely heavily on snowfall, other climactic conditions including freezing rain, avalanches, and wind, contribute to their growth.One year of below average precipitation can stunt the growth of a glacier tremendously. With the rare exception of surging glaciers, a common glacier flows about 10 inches per day in the sumer and 5 inches per day in the winter. The fastest glacial surge on record occurred in 1953, when the Kutiah Glacier in Pakistan grew more than 12 Kilometers in three months.

			</li>
			<li><b>C</b><br>
				The weight and pressure of ice accumulaion causes glacier movement. Glaciers move out from under themselves, via <i> plastic deformmaion and basal slippage</i>. First, the internal flow of ice crystals begins to spread outward and downward from the thickened snow pack also known as the zone of accumulation. Next, the ice along the ground surface begins to slip in the same direction. Seasonal thawing at the base of the glacier helps to facilitate thisslippage. The middle of a glacier moves faster than the sides and bottom because there is no rock to cause friction. The upper part of a glacier rides on the ice below. As a glacier moves it carves out a U-shaped valley similar to a riverbed, but with much steeper walls and a flatter bottm.

			</li>
			<li><b>D</b><br>
				Besides the extroalrdinary rivers of ice, glacial erosion creates other unique physical features in the landscape such as horns, fjords, hanging valleys, and cirques. Most of hese landforms do not gecome visible until after a glacier has receded. Many are created by moraines, which occur at the sides and front of a glacier.Moraines are formed when material is picked up along the way and deposited in a new location. When many alpine glaciers occur on the same mountain, these moraines can create a horn. The Matterhorn, in theSwiss Alps is one of the most famous horns. Fjords which are very common in Norway, are coastal valleys that fill with ocean water during a glacial retreat. Hanging valleys occur when two or more glacial valleys intersect at varying elevations. It is common for waterfalls to connect the higher and lower hanging valleys, such as in Yosemite national Park. A cirque is a large bowl-shaped valley that forms at the front of a glacier. Cirques often have a lip on their down slope that is deep enough to hold small lakes when the ice melts away.
			</li>
			<li><b>E</b><br>
				Glacier movement and shape shifting typically occur over hundreds of years. While presently about 10 percent of the earth's land is covered with glaciers, it is believed that during the last Ice Age glaciers covered approximately 32 percent of the earth's surface. In the past century, most glaciers have gbeen retreating rather than flowing forward. It is unknown whether this glacealactivity is due to human impact or natural causes, but by studying glacier movement, and comparing climate and agricultural profiles ovr hundreds of years, glaciologists can begin to understand evironmental issues such as global warming.
