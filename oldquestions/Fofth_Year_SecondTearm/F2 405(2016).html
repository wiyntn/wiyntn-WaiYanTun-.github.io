				The Online Bus Ticket REservation System is used to book tickets for some local trips.Using the system, the customer can browse through departure place, destrination place, trip schedule; departure/arrival times and can select bus. While booking the bus, customer has to give mobile number, name, email address and number of tickets want. After selection the us and journey root, if the ticket is available then customer can select the seat in bus. Tehn we can make payment for the ticket booking confirmation or user can print the ticket from home page of the online system. The ticket can be cncelled by entering ticket number and email id that  is given while booking the ticket. After cancel process successful, the confirmation message will be sent to mobile number.

				A hockey league is made up of at least four hockey teams. Each hockey team is composed of six to twelve players, and one player captains the team. A team has a name and record. Players have a number and a position. Hockey teams play games against each other. Each game has a score and a location. Teams are sometimes lead by a coach. A coach has a level of accreditation and number of years of experience, and can coach nultiple tams. Coaches and players are people, and people have names and addresses.

			<li>A window in a window management system on a computer can be displayed in one of three states: maximized, where it takes up the entire screen; normal, where it is displayed as a bordered window with a given size and position on the screen; and iconized, where it is displayed as a small icon. When a window is opened, it will be displayed as a normal window, unless minimize on use has been selected, in which case it will be displayed as an icon. A normal window and an icon can be mazimized; a maximized window and a norma window can be minimized or reduced to a icon. Maximized windows cab be restored to their normal size and icons can be minimized or reduced to an icon. Maximized windows can be restored to their normal size and icons can be restored to the size they had before they were minimized. Icons and normal windows can be moved and normal windows can also be reszed, No matter how it is displayed, a window can always be closed.<br>
