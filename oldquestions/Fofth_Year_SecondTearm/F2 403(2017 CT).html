		<ol type="a">
			<li>Write an 8051 assembly language program to implement the binary counter and displaying the counter content using the 8 LEDs interfaced to Port 2 of the microcontroller and is arranged in a single row with the LED connected to P2.0 at the rightmost postion (LSB) and the LED connected to P2.7 at the leftmost position (MSB). Each LED represents the corresponding binary bit of a byte and the LED is turned on when the port line is at logic 0. Use a 12 MHz crystal resonator for generation  the mecessary clock signal for the controller. The counting starts from "0" and increments by one. The counter is incremented at the rate of 5 seconds. When the counter is at "255", the next increment reset s the counter to "0" and the counting proces is repeated.

			<li>Design an 8051 microcontroller based data acquisition system for interfacing the Analog to Digital Converter ADC, AdC0801 from National Semiconductors. The system should satisfy the followings:

				<ol type="i">
					<li>Use Atmel's At89C51/52 9Flash microcontroller with In System Programming (ISP support) for designing the system.

						</li>
						<li>use a 12MHz crystal resonator for generating the necessay clock singal for the controller. Ue on-chip program memory for storing the program instructions.
						</li>
						<li>The data lines of the ADC are interfaced to Port 2 of the microcontroller. The control signals(RD\, WR\, CS\,) to the ADC is supplied through Port 3 pins of microcontroller.
						</li>
						<li>The Analog voltage range for conversion if from 0V to 5V. The varying analog input voltage is generated from the 5V supply voltage (Vcc) using a variable resistor (Potentiometer). The ADC asserts its interrupt the microcontroller when the AD conversion is over and data is available at the ADC data port.
						</li>
						<li>The microcontroller reads the data on receiving the interrupt and stores it in the memory.The successive data conversion is initiated after reading the converted data for a sample.Only the most recent 16 samples are stored in the microcontroller memory.<b id="right">(20 marks)</b>
