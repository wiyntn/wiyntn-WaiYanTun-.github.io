			<li>R2/3000 series microprocessors employ a five -stage instruction pipeline such as IF: instruction fetchinng, FE: operand loading while decoding the fetched instruction, EX: data processing, MA:operand accessing and WB: operand storing. Illustrate how instruction pipeline is fully utilized and outputs a new result every clock cycle from a start-up phase to 9 clock cycles under ideal situatin. If the instruction sequence in this straming mode of operation is LD, ADD, ST, SUB, what would occur in this pipeline? Again, illustrate how this situationcan be dealt with different ways in the instruction pipeline.<b id="right">(9 marks)</b>

			<li>The hardware cost of a new m-stage, single-function pipeline is approximated by 22m + 30. The latency of the function to be executed is 90 ns if pipelining is not used. The pipelined implementation's interstage buffers are eexpected to add an additional 10m ns to this latency. Estimate the number ob stages needed to optimize the pipeline's performance/cost ratio.<b id="right">(9 marks)</b>

			<li>A RAM is to be designed with a target cpacity of 16 MB. Three DRAM ICs of the kind shown in Figure 3(a) are available to serve as components: (i) a 4M x 1 bit DRAM costing $22 per IC; (ii) 1Mx2 bit DRAm costing $10; and (iii) a 256Kx8bit DRAM costing $4.50.Access circuitry, include ICs and writing is estimated to cost $ x + 10y, where x is the number of RAM ICs used and y is number of address bits to be decoded exteernally. Determine which type of DRAM IC would minimize the cost of the memory.<b id="right">(12 marks)</b><br>
