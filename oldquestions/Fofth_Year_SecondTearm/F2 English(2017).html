		<ol type="A">
			<li>The software tolls of search are typically more abundant than hardware tools in the social sciences.Software is usually thought of as meaning computer programs that tell the hardware what to do, but any tool not related to a physical device can be considered software. Include in this category are published tests and questionnaires.

			</li>
			<li>Often researchers want to gather information related to a general area such as personality of intelligence. For these instances, the use of a standardized test may be the best choice. With already published tests you can be sure of both validity and reliability and can save a lot of time that might otherwise be spent on test construction. Standardized tests can be classifid into five main categories: achievement, aptitude, interest, personality, and intelligence.
			</li>
			<li>
				Achievment tests are designed specifically to measure an individeual's previously learned knowledge or ability. They are availabel for many-topic areas related to psychhology, education, business, and other fields. Achievement tests require that prior learning take place and that this learning be demonstrated in order to pass.
			</li>
			<li>
				Aptitude tests attempt to predict an individual's performance in some activity at some point in the future. They do not require any specific prior learning although basic knowledge related to reading and writing is usually required and some preparation, such as studying up on math formulas or sentence structure, can be helpful. A well-known example of this type is the Scholastic Achievment Test (SAT), designed to predict future college performance.
			</li>
			<li>Interest inventories also require only general knowledge but no preparation is needed. These tests look at an individual's subjective interests in order to make predictions about some future behavior or activity. Peerhaps the most used interest inventory is the Strong Interest Inventory, whcih compares interests related to specific careers in order to help huide an individual's career path. Endorsed interests are compared with the interests of successful individuals in various fields and predictiosn are made regarding the test-taker's fit with the various career fields. 
			</li>
			<li>Typicaly designed to assess and diagnose personallity and mental health related disorders, personality tests are used extensively by psychologists in clinical, deucational, and business related settings. By far the most widely used test of this type is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition (MMPI-2), which compares an individual's responses on a series of true-false items to those suffering from various mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety. The theory behind the test argues that if you endorse items endorsed by those with depression for example, then the chances that yu are also depressed increases.
			</li>
			<li>
				intelligence tests could be calssified as aptitude tests since they are sometimes used to predict futured performance. They could also be calssifeid as  personality tests since they can be used to diagnosed disorders such as learning disabilities and mental retardation. However, because of their limited scoped we will place them in their own category. The purpose of an intelligence test is to attain a summary score or intelligence quotient (IQ) of an individual's intellectual ability. Scores are compared to each other and can be broken down into different subcategories depending on the intelligence test used. The most commonly used tests of this type are the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of INtelligence (WPPSI).
			</li>
			<li>
				Self-response quesionaires are a great way to gather large amounts of information in a relatively short amount of time. A questionnaire , similar to a survey you might see on a web page, allows subject to respond to questions, rate responses, of offer opinions. Their responses can then be used to place them in specific categories or groups or can be compared to other subjects for data naalysis. A concern with self-report, however, si the accuracy of the responses. Unlike direct observaton, there is no way of knowing if the subject has told the truth  or whether or not the question was understood as intended. There are several different methods for gathering information on a questionnaire or survey, including a Lidert scale is a popular method used in surveys because it allows the researcher to quantify opinion based items. Questions are typically grouped together and rated or responded to base on a five-point scale. This scale typically ranges in order from one extreme to the other, such as (1) very interested; (2) somewhat interested; (3)unsure; (4)not very interested; and (5) not interested at all. Items that might be rated with this scale representing the subject's level of interest could a list of careers academic majors, for example.
