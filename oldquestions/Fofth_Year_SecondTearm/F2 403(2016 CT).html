	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Write an 8051 assembly language program for polling based serial data communication with a PC. The program should configure the serial communication settings as: baudrate = 9600, IStart bit, 8 data bits and 1 Stop bit. The system echoes (send back) the data byte received from the PC to the PC. On receiving a data byte from the SErial port it is indicated through the flashing of an LED connected to a port pin. Use Maxim's MAX232 RS-232 level shigter IC for converting the TTL serial data signal to RS-23 compatible voltage levels. Use on-chip program memory for the storing the program instructions.
