	<li>Of-the-Month (OTMC) is an innovation young firm that sells membershis to people who have an interest in certain products/services. People pay membership fees for one year and the club sends them a special product of theri interest each month. For example, OTMC has a coffee-of-the month club that sends members one pound of special coffee each month. OTMC currently has six products of memberships; coffee, wine, beer, cigars, flowers, adn computer games and each of which cost a different amount. Customers usually belong to just one product, but some belong to two or more products. When people join OTMC, the telephone operatior records the name, mailing address, phone, number, email address, credit-card information, start date, adn membership product(s),e.g.,coffee.<br><br>

	<li>Consider the world of libraries. A library has books, videos and CDs that it loans to its users.All library material has an id and a title. In additions, books have one or more authors, videos have one or more actors, while CDs have one or more entertatiners. The library maintains one or more copies of each library item (books, video, or CD). Copies of all library materials can be loaned to users. references-only material is loaned for 2hrs and can't be removed from the library. Other materials
	can be loaned fro 2 weeks. For ever loan, the library records the user's id, the loan date and teh return date. The library maintains users' names, address and phone number.<b id="right">(15 marks)</b>

	<li>Assume that you have to develop a computer system for the library described in No.(4) above. Only members of the library may borrow books. The system checks whether the potential borrower is a member of the library, and whether there is no reservation on the book. If both check succeed the system records that the book is on loan. Otherwise if refuses the loan. A member may ask to extend the loan of the book. The system then checks whether there is a reservation on the book. If so, the system refuses to extend the loan. Otherwise it records the extension of the loan.<br>

In this state, user can choose washing plans such as <b>regular or delicate</b> or <b>super delicate.</b> When user press <b>Start</b> after setting the washine plan, the machine starts to soak in the water (pump in) for <b>30 mins,</b> then it starts rinsing (washing) by stirring for another <b>30 mins.</b> If user sets the delicate or super delicate washing plan, the machine skips teh soak in process and starts rinsing (washing) by stirring for <b>30 mins.</b> After the rinse process is stopped and it starts draining (pump out) for <b>5 mins.</b>
