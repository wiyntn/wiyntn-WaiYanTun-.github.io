		<b>Right and left-handedness in humans</b><br>
		Why do humans, virtyally alone among all animal species, display a distinct left or right-handedness? Not ever our closest relatives among the apes possess such decided lateral asymmetry, as psychologists call it. Yet about 90 per cent of every human population that has ever lived appears to have been right-haded. Professor Bryan Turner at Deakin University has studied the research literature on left-handedness and found that handedness goes with sidedness. So nine out of ten people are right-handed and eight are right-footed. He noted that this distinctive asymmety in the human population is itself systematic. 'Humans think in categories: black and while, up and down, left and right. It's a system of signs that enables us to categorize phenomena that are essentially ambiguous.'<br>
		Research has shown that there is genetic or inherited element to handedness. But while left-handedness tends to run in families, neither left nor right handers will automatically produce off-spring with the same handedness; in fact about 6 per cent of children with two right-handed parents will be left-handed.15 to 20 per cent of the offspring will be left--handed. Even among identical twins who have exactly the sme genes, one in six pairs will differ in their handednesss.<br>
		What then makes people left-handed if it is not simply genetic? Other factors must be at work and researchers have turned to the brain for clues. In the 1860s the French sutgeon and anthropologist, Dr.Paul Broca, made the remarkable findjing that patients who hand lost .He noted that since the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right half of the body, and vice versa, the brain damage must have been int he brain's, while 5 per cent have right-sided language. Left-handers, however, do hot show th eereverse pattern but instead a majorty also have their language in the left hemisphere. Some 30 per cent have right hemisphere language.<br>
		Dr. Brinkman, a grain researcher at the Autralian National University in Canberrra, has suggested that evolution of sppec h went with right-handed performance. According to Brinkman, as the brain evolved, one side became specialied for fine control of movement (necessary for producing speech) and along with this evolution came right-hand preference. According to Brinman, msot left-handers have lfrt hemisphere dominance but also some capacity in the right heisphere. She has obsered that if a lefr-handed person is brain-damaged  n the left hemisphere, th recovery of speech is quite often better and this is explained by the fact that left-handers have a more bilateral speech function.<br>
		In her studies of macaque monkeys, Brinkman has noticed that primates (monkeys) seem to learn a hand preference from their mother in the first year of life but this could be one hand or the other. In humans, however, the specialisation in function of the two hemispheres results in anatomical differences: areas that are have not acquierd the art of speech are usually larger on the left side than on the right. Since monkeys have not acquired the art of speech, one would not expect ot see such a variation byt Brinkman claims to have discovered a trend in monkeys towared the asymmetry that is evident in the human brain.<br>
