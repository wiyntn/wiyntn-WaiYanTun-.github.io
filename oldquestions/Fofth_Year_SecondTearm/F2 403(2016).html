			<li>A data file is shared among several concurrent processes. Some of these processes may want only to read teh content of the shared file, whereas others may want to update it. So, there are two types of precesses, writer, writing into file and reader, reading from the file. In our system, we require that every writer process have exclusive when writing to the same file.However all reader processes can get concurrent access when reading a file.
