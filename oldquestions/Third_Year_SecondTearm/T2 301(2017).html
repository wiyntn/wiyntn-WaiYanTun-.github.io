	Consider the disk scheduling proble: we assume that a disk with 250 tracks and that the disk request there has random request in it. The requested tracks, in the order received by the disk scheduler are 128, 180,39,165,68,95,220.Assume that starting track is 150 in the direction increasing track number.
