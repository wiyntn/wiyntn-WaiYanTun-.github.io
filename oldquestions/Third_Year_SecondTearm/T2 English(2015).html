		Ebonices---- also known by a host of other names such as African American Vernacular English, Black English, Black Vernacular, and so on----- is an African-American language that has its roots in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, as African captives devised the menas to communicate with each other ans with their captors. In the South of the United States, these Pan-African languages comingled with Standard English and the Southern dealect. Many uniuely African-American components have arisen over the last two centuries, and all of these influences have forged what is now known as Ebonics.<br>

		In 1996, debates around the natrue of "Ebonices" in the United States came to a head. That year, the Oakland Unified School District in California enacted Resolution 597-003, which officially recognised that African-American students " as part  of their culture and history as African people possess and utilize a langurage". Alternatively referred to as Ebonics (literally "black sounds"),
		African Communication Behaviours, and Arican Language Systems, this language was declared to be "genetically-based" rather than a dialect of Standard English.<br>

		Within the profession of language reserch and pedagogy, a strong consensus formed behind the OUSD's decision to recognise Ebonics. Linguistics professor John Rickford noted that Ebonics was not simply characterised by erroneous grammar and a large slang vacabulary, but that underlying this language was a structured form and process of grammar and phonology that made English learnign for Ebonics speakers far more complex a task than simply dropping bad habits. English teachers, Rickford counselled, must therefore accept and embrace these complexities.<br>

		The Linguistic Society  of America (LSA) concurred with Rickford adding that whether or not Ebonics should be defined as a dialect or a language does not matter in terms of its "validity". While linguists studying Ebonics typically restrain from prescibing edicts in favour of tracking changes in form and style, the LSA did point to the fact that speakers of Swedish and Norwegian can typically wunderstand each other while conversiong in different "languages" whereas Mandarin and Cantonese speakers cannot understand each other's "dialects" to conclude that spatial and social tensions, rather than strict linguistic cirteria, were the cucial factors in fefining these terms.<br>

		For many others, however, the OUSD's decision was tantamount ot endorsing lazy, vulgar and "broken" English---- the equivalent, perhaps of acknowledging "txt" speack or Internet slang as a valid form of expression. Recognising and fostering the use of informal, cultrually-specific spoken language,asy these detracots, traps users in a kind of linguistic ghetto in which they can interact wiht other disenfranchised and excluded citizens, but cannot engage within the public sphere in a meaningful way. Because of the dominance of Standardard English in theUnited States, Ebnics-only speakers are essentially unable to go to university and work in high-valued professins, and they are unlikely to be electabel to any kind of public offece (even in areas with a high desity of black residents, those who lose their Ebonics-tinged speech patterns ted to be more trusted).<br>

		Paychology professor Ladonna Lewis Rush has noted, however, that the OUSD's resolution did not promote Ebonics instruction as an alternative to Standar English in an either-or approach, but was intended to provide a better springboard for black achievement in English education. The systematic de-valuation of Ebonics in American society parallels, Rush has argued, the de-valuation of African-Americans in general.While a demenaing attritude can lead to social exclusion, teachers are suggested to think inclusive and encourage Ebonics speakers to use and celebrate their way of speaking while under-standing that the langyage of the workplace, and of academics, si Standard English. Nobel Prize-winning journalist Toni Morrison has also found a reciprocal, mutually enriching use for both Ebonics and Standard English."There are certain ideas and ways of thinking I cannot say without recourse to my [Ebonics] language....I know the Standard English. I want to use it to restore the other language, the lingua franca".<br>

		In the media, the Ebonics controversy has mostly been portrayed as a revival of black-versus-white confrontation-this time over linguistic differences-but journalist Joan Walsh thinks there are basic elements inherent in the dispute that people don not want to openly disctance . She considers htat there is increasing resentment by black parents and teachers who see enormous amounts of federal and state support going into Asian and Latino bilingual programmes. As immigration continues to increase, a greater proportion ot the school budgest is going into these programmes. The question has to be raised: why should immigrant children getEnglish-language assistance as well as reinforcement of hteir own language and culture while native-born African-Americans get no such resources? Walsh maintains inner city black children are more isolated than in the past and have less social interaction with those fluent in Standard English. For this reason they need help by trained teachers to translate the native tongue they hear at home into the English of the classroom.<br>

		Ebonics should be treated as a black contribution to cluture in the way that jazz and rock-and-rool has been welcomed-the new vocabulary and imagery has added to the American language rather than devalued it. In Walsh's eyes there has always been "white mistrust of how black people handle their business", but "in the public realm, white disdain yields black intrasigence more reliably than 'i' comes before 'e' ."
