			<li>The performance of a 100 MHz microptrocessor P is measured by executing 10,000,000 instructions of benchmark code, which is found to take 0.25s. What are the values of CPI and MIPS for this performance experiment? Is P likely to be superscalar?
			</li>
			<li>Let A= A(1), A(2),...,A(1000) and B = B(1), B(2),.....,B(1000) be two vectors, that is one-dimensional arrays of numbers to be added. The descried vector sum C = A + B is defined by C(1), C(2),...,C(1000) = A(1) + B(1), A(2) + B(2),....,A(1000) + B(1000).Write down the IAS program for this vector addition. The vectors A, B, and C are assumed to be stored sequentially, beginning at locations 1001, 2001, and 3001, respectively.<b id="right">(20 marks)</b></li>

			<li>A certain computer system executes a stream of tasks in a manner that can be accurately modeled by an M/M/1 queueing system. The computer is busy 75 percent of the time, and the average job spends four minutes in the computer. (a) How many jobs are in the computer on average? (b) What is the maximum rate at which jobs may arrive at the system before it becomes overloaded? State clearly your definition of overloaded.<b id="right">(20 marks)</b></li>

			<li>Design a 8-input multiplexer/data selector using two copies of 4-inpur multiplexer/data selector. You may use a few additional gates of any standard types in your design, if needed.</li>
			<li>Design at the register level a modulo-16 binary up-down counter CNTR. The counter has three funtion control input lines LOAD, which loads the counter with an initial value from a 4-bit external bus BUS, and COUNT, which increments or decrements the counter by one, and DOWN, where DOWN = 1, causes the counter to count down (decrement) and DOWN = 0, causes the conter to count up. The availabel component types(use as many of each as you need) for building CNTR are teh 4-bit D registe; the two-input 4-bit multiplexer; and the two-input m-bit NAND word gate with <br>m=1,2, and 4.<b id="right">(20 marks)</b>

			<li>Write an assembly language program for the multiplication operation AC:= AC x N where the multiplicand is the initial contents of the accumulator AC and the multiplier N ia a variable stored in memory. Assume that the multiplier and multiplicand are both unsigned numbers and that they are sufficiently small that the product will fit in a single word. Use the instruction set of accumulator-based CPU shown in the Table (4-b) for the program.<br>
