	<b>Question I:</b>Read the passage below and answer Question 1-10.<span id="right"><b>(20 marks)</b></span><br>
	<b>A History of Figerprinting</b><br>
	<b>A:</b> To detectives, the answers lie at the end of our fingers.Fingerprinting offers an accurate and infallible means of personal identification. The ability fo identify a  person from a mere fingerptint is a powerful tools in the fight against crime. It is the most commonly used forensic evidence, often outperforming other methods of identification. These days, older methods of ink fingerprinting, which could take weeks, have given way to newer, faster techniques like fingerprint laser scanning, but the principles stay the same. No matter which way you collect fingerprint evidence, every single person's print is unique. So, what makes our fingerprints different from our neighbour's?<br>
	<b>B:</b> A good place to start is to understand what fingerprints are and how they are creted.A fingerprint is the arrangement of skin ridges and furrows on the tips of the fingers. This ridged skin develops fully during foetal development, as the skin cells grow in the mother's life. Other wisible human characteristics, like weight and height, genes combine with environmental influences, such as temperature, it affects the way the ridges on the skin grow. It makes the ridges develop at different rates, buckling and bending into patterns. As a result, no two people end up having the same fingerprints.Even identical twins possess dissimilar fingerprints.<br>
	<b>C:</b> It is not easy to map the journey of how the unique of the fingerprint came to be discovered. The moment in history it happened is not entirely clear. Howerover, the use of fingerprinting can be traced back to some ancient civilisations, such as Babylon and China, where thumbprints were pressed onto clay tablets to confirm business transactions. Whether piople at this time actually realised the full extent of how fingerprints were important for identification purposes is another matter altogether. One cannot be sure if the act was seen as a means to confirm identity or a symbolic gesture to bind a contract, where giving your fingerprint was like giving your word.
	<br>
	<b>D:</b>Despite this uncertainty, there are those who made a sgnificant contribution towards the analysis of fingerprinting. History tells us that a 14<sup>th</sup> centry Persian doctor made an early statement that no two fingerprints are alike. Later, in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, italian Physician Marcello Malpighi studied the sitighuishing shapes of loops and spirals in fingerprinting. In his honour, the medical world later named a layer of skin after him.It was, however, an employee for the East India Company, William Hershel, who came to see the true potential of fingerprintints from the local people as a form of signature for contracts, in order to avoid fraud. His fascination with fingerprints propelled him to study them form the next twenty years.He developed the theory that fingerprints were unique to an individual and did not chage at all over a lifetime.In 188o Henry Faulds suggested that fingerprints could be usde to indentify convicted criminals. He wrote to Charles Darwin for davice, and the idea was referred on to Darwin's cousin, Sir Francis Gaton. Galton eventually published an in-depth stydy of fingerprint science in 1892.<br>
	<b>E:</b> Although the fact that each person has a toally unique fingerprint pattern had been well documented and accepted for a long time, this knowledge was not exploited for criminal identification until tify a criminal.  the early 20<sup>th</sup>
	century. In the past, branding, tattooing and maiming had been used to mark the cirminal for what he was. In some countries, thieves would have their hands cut off.France branded criminals with the fleur-de-lis-symbol. The Romans tattooed mercenary soliders to stop them from becoming deserters.<br>
	<b>F:</b> For many years police agencies in the Western world were reluctant to use fingerprinting, much preferring the popular method of the time, the Bertillon System, where dimensions of certain body parts were recorded to identify a criminal. The truning point was in 1903 when a prisoner by the name of Will West was admitted into Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Amazingly, Will had almost the same Bertillon measurements as another prisoner sesiding at the same prison, whose name happened to be William West. It was only their fingerprints that could tell them apart. From that point on, fingerprinting became standerd form criminal identification.<br>
	<b>G:</b> Fngerprinting was useful in identifying people with a history of crime and who were listed on a database.
	However, in situations where the perpetrator was not on the databse and a crime had no witnesses, the system fell short. Fingerprint chemistry is a new technology that can work alongside traditional fingerprinting to find more clues than ever before. Form organic compounds left behind on a print, a scientist can tell if the person is a child, an adult, a marture person or a smoker, and much more. It seems, after all these, fingers continue to point the way.
