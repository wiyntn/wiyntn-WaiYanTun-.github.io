		<h3 style="text-align:center">The Risks of Cigarette Smoke
		</h3>
	</p>
	Discovered in the early 1800s and named nicotianine, the oily essence now called nicotione is the main active ingredient of tobacco.Nicotine, however, is only a small computer of cigarette smoke, which contains more than 4,700 chemical compounds, including 43 cancer-causing substances.In recent times, scientific reserch has been providing evidence that, years of cigarette smoking vastly increases the risk of developing fatal medical conditions.<br>
	In addition to being responsible for more than 85 per cent of lung cancers, smoking is associated with cancers of amongst others, the mouth, stomach and kidneys, and is thought to cause about 14 percent of leukaemia and cervical cancers.In 1990, smoking caused more than 84,000 deaths, mainly resulting from such porblems as pneumonia, bronchitis and influenza. Smoking it is believed, is responsible for 30 percent of all deaths from cancer and clearly represents the most important preventable cause of cancer in countriesl like the Unnited States today.<br>
	Passive smoking, the breathing in of the side-stream smoke from the burning of tobacco between puffs of of the smoke exhaled by a smoker, also causes a serious health risk. A rwport published in 1992 by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emphasised the health dangers, especially from side-stream smokd.This type of smoke contains more, smaller particles and is thereforem more likely to be deposited deep in the lungs. ON the basis of theis report, the EPA has classified environmental tobacco smoke in the highest risk category for causing cancer.
	<br>
	As an illustration of the health risks, in the case of a married couple where on partner is a smoker and one a non-smoker, the latter is believed to have a 30 percent higher risk of death from heart disease because of passive smoking. The risk of lung cancer also increases over the years of epxposure and the figure jumps to 80 percent if the spouse has been smoking four packs a day for 20 years.It has been calculated theat 17 percent of cases of lung cancer can be attributed to high levels of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke during childhood and adolescence.<br>
	A more recent stydy by researchers at the University of Caligornia at San Francisco (UCSF) has shown that secound-hand cigarette smoke does more harm to non-smokers that to smokeers.Leaving aside the philosophical question of whether anyone should have to breathe someone else's cigarette smoke, the report suggests that the smoke experienced by may people in their daily lives is enougn to produce substantial adverse effects on a person's heart and lungs.<br>
	The report, published in the Journal of the American Medicl Association (AMA), was based on the researchers' own earlier research but also includes a review of studies over the past few years.The American Medical Association represents about half of all US doctors and is a strong opponent of smoking. The study suggests that people who smoke cigarettes are continually damaging their cardiovasular  system, which adapts in order th compensate for the effects of smoking.It further states that people who do smoke do not have the benefit of ther system adaptiong to the smoke inhalation.Consequently, the effets of passive smoking are far greater on non-smokers than on smokers.
	<br>
	This report emphasises that cancer is not caused by a sinngle element in cigarette smoke; harmful effects to health are caused by many components.Carbon monoxide, for example, competes with oxygen in red blood cells and interferes with the blood's ability to deliver life-giving oxygen to the geart. Nicotine and other toxins in cigarette smoke activate small blood cells called platelets, which increases the likelihook of blood clots, thereby affecting blood circulation throughout the body.<br>
	The researchers cirticiese the practice of some scientific consultants who work with the tobacco industry for assuming that cigarette smoke has hte sme impact on smokers as it does on non-smokers.They argue that those scientists are underestimationg the damage done by passive smoking and , in support of their recent findings, cite some previous research which points to passive smoking as the cause for between 30,000 and 60,000 deaths from theart attacks each year in the United States. This menas that passive smoking is the thire most preventable cause of deathe afeter active smoking and alcohol-related diseases.<br>
	The study argues that the type of action needed against passive smoking should be similar to that being taken against illegal drugs and AIDS(SIDA). The UCSF researchers maintain that the simplest and most cost-effective action is to establish smoke-free workplaces, schools and public places.
