			Write a short note List six categories of assessing project feasibility. Assuming monetary benefits of an information system at $50,000 per year one-time costs of $42,500, recurring costs $28,500 per year, a dis ount rate of 12 percent, and a five-year time horizon, calculate the net present value of thesed costs and benefits of an information syste. Also calculate the overall returen on investment of the project and then present a break-even analysis. At what point does break-even occur?<b id="right">(10 Marks)</b>

		<li>A restnaurant chain has several store locations in a city (with a name and zip code stored for each), and each is managed by one mangaer. Managers manage only one store. Each restaurant location has its own unique set of menaus. Most have more than one menu (e.g., lunch and dinner menus). Each menu has many menu items, and items cna appear on multiple meanus, and with different prices on different menus. Represent this situation of restaurants with an E-R diagram.<b id="right">(10 marks)</b>
