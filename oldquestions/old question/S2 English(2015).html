		<b>QUESTION-1<b id="right">(20 Marks)</b></b><br>
		Language is an extraordinary institution, standing in as much need of explanation as any other aspect of human life, possibly more. But to explain it, one has to stop taking it for granted. Vitrually all of us are pretty fluent employers of language; we grow up with it as we grow up with the ability to walk or run, and using it seems as easy as those activities. To see how truly remarkable language is, we must, as the psychologist Wolfgang Kohler put it, retreat to a 'psychic distance' from the subject.<br><br>
		Langueage is the most complex and sophisticated of our possessions. Only very recently, for instance, have grammarians begun to uncover the enormously complicated rules of grammar which underlie our languages, and the still have a long way to go. Computers can be marvelous at dealing with mathematics and playing chess. Yet, at least at present, no computer is at all close to the reproduction of human verbal abilities. Computers are, at best, second-rate users of language, while animals are not users of language at all.
		<br><br>
		Talking might be seen as the defining characteristic of human beings. No doube we are also the only creatures who laugn, and have two legs and no feathers-but that is not too interesting. We may be the only creatures who use tools and who organizae politically- and this is more interesting. Still, amongst many peoples, political organization and the use of tools are extremely rudimentary, whereas all known communities have possessed sophisticated languages. Further, if is probably easier to fine analogies in the animal world to tools and politics than it is to language.<br><br>
		Many animals, of course, are capable of producing noises which cause their friends or enemies to respond in certain ways, but these noises are so different in kind from human speech that it is, at best, a misleding analogy to speak of such noises being part of a language. First, animals are incapale of organizing their noises into sequences beyound the most primitive level, whereas the most salient characterstic of human talkers is their ability  The would be acapable of true speech. We might not want to go as far as that, but at least we must admit that speech is one, if not the, salient feature of human nature which distinguishes it from any other sort of nature.<br><br>
		Not only is langurag our most sophisticated, importnat and uniwue possessiion, it is also, remarkably enough, and almost universal human possession. As already mentioned, all known humn societies have possessed a language, whatever else each of them may have lacked. Not only that, but whereas there are mathematical geniuses and hess-plying geniuses, when it comes to language, nearly all of us are capable of producing and understanding an infinite number of sentences.<br><br>
		Language is also remarkable in its versatility. By uttering the appropriate noises, in the right circumstances, a single person in a single day can easily do each of the following: inform others of what is happening, ask them to do something, command them, excite them promise them, insult them, express anger and get married. As some of these examples show, we do not in general utter them. We perform actions with works, actions which it would be difficut, inconvenient or even impossible to performa without works. The number of such possible actions is indefinitely large.<br><br>
