				<li>The general three-part microinstruction format comprising a condition-select filed, a branch address field, and a set of control fields will be used for a twos-complement multiplication algorithm implementing with extended CPU as shown in Figure-1(a).Conditions to be tested are seven including brach conditions.There are 29 control signals which will not b encoded for the extended CPU. Suppose that an 8-bit tranch address denoting a complete CM address is included in each microinstruction, how many words will be needed for the CM? Draw a possible orgnization for microprogrammed control unit of this CPU With the design assumptions given.<br>

				<li>The 2909 microprogram sequencer as shown in the Figure-2(a) generates microinstruction addresses for a control memory CM and comprises a microprogram counter ÂµPC, 4x4 bit stack ST, register R, multiplexer MUX and all logic needed for next-address generation. Design the structure of this sequencer.<br>

				<li>(i)Defien the different types of data hazards that can occurs in pipeline. (ii) Consider the following MIPS code sequence that increments a vector of values in memory (starting at 0(R1), and with the last element at 8(R2)), by a scalar in register F2 in a five-stage istruction pipeline of IF, ID, EX, MA and WB. Estimate the data haxard that could involve in this code sequence and explain why.<br>

				<li>In a paging system, memory M<sub>1</sub> has a capacity of <i>three</i> pages. The execution of a prgram requires reference to five distinct pages <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> where <i>i=</i>1,2,3,4,5 and <i>i</i> is the page address. The page address stream formed by executing the program is,<br>
					1 2 3 4 1 2 5 1 2 3 4 5<br>
					which means that the first page referenced is P<sub>1</sub>, the second is <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>, and so on. (i)Illustrate the assignment of pages to M<sub>1</sub> using Least Recently Used. (ii) Repeat the case in (i)for M<sub>1</sub> having a capacity of <i>four</i> pages. <br>
