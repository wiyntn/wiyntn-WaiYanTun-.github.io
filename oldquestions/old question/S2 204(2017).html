				<li>The Car Park class has to monitor the number of space left in the car park each time a car arrives or leaves. The Full Sign class has to light up when there are no spaces left in the car park and to turn off when a space becomes available. The Barrier clss ths to provide information to the Car Park class each time that a car enters a car park. The Barrier clss has responsibilities to raise the exit barrier if a car whshes to leave the car park and to lower it when the car is throh. In order to do this, the Barrier clss has to receive information from a sensor, which detects the presence or absence of a car. Draw the CRC cards for each class to illustrate the responsibilities and collaborations in this situation.<b id="right">(8 Marks)</b>

				<li>Draw a state diagram which describes the lifetime of a DVD as descibed in the following paragraph and writes a scenario for this case. A customer can rent DVDs from the Block Buster Video. The status of a DVDs is either rented, availabe,e expiered (if it has rented a maximum number of times), damaged or sold (if it was sold to a customer). Each DVD has a lifespan (a maximum number of times that it can be rented). A newly created DVD has a lifespan of 50 rentals. (A DVD can be rented only for 50 times). A non-damaged, availabel rental item can either be rented or sold to a customer. An expiered rent item can only be sold. You can ask for the status of a rent item. All DVD can be rented by a cutomer and returned. When an item is returned, the clerk who handles the transaction labels it "OK" or "damaged" depending on its status. Consider in which state a DVD should be to start with. You do not have to include a stop state on the diagram.<b id="right">(15 marks)</b>
