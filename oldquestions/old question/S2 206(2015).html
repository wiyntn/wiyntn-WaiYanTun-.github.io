		<li>American labs provide lab testing services for a variety of clients, mostly doctors' offices and other small medical businesses throughout the Midwest. Clients send test vials containing blood samples or other test requests to American labs' testing center, where the requests tests are performed, after which the results are sent back to the client via fax.<br>
			Jim larsen, the technician in the testing facility at American Lab has approached you for help with the company's ourdated inventory tracking system Business has picked up recently, and the turnaround for clients' requested tests has been lenghening. To make matters worse, the lab technicians are seldom able to give customers an answer regarding where their requests fall in the testing queue or how long they can expect the turnaround to be. Much of this stems from an old, mostly paper-based inventory tracking system, which includes hand-written labels put on each of the incoming test vials and a log- book with entries made for each vila at each stage of the testing process.<br>
			Jim would like to streamline the inventory tracking process with a updated information system that uses barcodes and a modern database to keep track of customers test requests and the accompanying vials. he would like to enable technicians to provide accurate status updates and turnaround estimates, and generally shorten the trunicians to procide accurate status updates and trunaround estimates, and generally shorten the turnaroung time for test requests.<br>
			After an initial analysis, you make the following estimations. You eill use these data as part of your initial feasibility assessment.<br>

				<li>A company has various rules for how payments to suppliers are to be authorizes. Some payments are in response to an approvied purchase order. For approved purchase ordeers under $5,000, the accounting clerk can immediately issue a check against that purchase order and sign the check. For approved purchas orders between $5,000 and $10,000, te accounting clerk cna immediately issue a check but must additionallly obtain a second signature. payments for approved puchase orders over $10,000 always require the approval of the accounting manager to issue the check as well as the signature of two accounting clerks.Payment that are not covered by a purchase order that under $5,000 must be approved by the accounting manager and a departmental manager that will absorb the cost of the payment into that department's budgeest. 
					Such checks can be signed by a single accounting clerk. Payments that are not covered by a purchase order that are between $5,000 and $10,000 must be approved by the acccounting menager and a departemntal manager, and the check must have two signatures. Finally, payments exceeding S10,000 that are not covered by a purchase rder must be approved by a department manager, the accounting manager, and the chief financial officer. Such checks require two signatures. Create <b>a decision table</b> to represent the logic in this process.<b id="right"> (10 marks)</b></li>

					A laboratory has several chemists who work on one or more projects. Chemists also may use certain kinds of equipments on each project. Attributes of CHEMIST include Employee_ID (identifier) and Name, and Phone_No. Attributes of PROJECT include Project_ID(identifier) and Start_Date. Attributes of EQUIPMENT include Serial_No and Cost. The organization wishes to record Assign_Date-that is, the date when a given equipment item was assigned to a particular chemist working on a specified project. A chemist must be assigned to at least one project and one equipment item. A given project need not be assigned either a chemist or an equipment item.

			As the lead analyst for the Hoosier Burger project, you have worked closely with Bob and Thelma Mellankamp. Having completed the systems analysis  phase, you are now ready to begin designing the new Hoosier Burger information system. As the lead analyst on this project, you are responsibale for overseeing the development of the forms, reports, and deatabses requreed by the new system. Becausee the inventory system is being automated and a new delivery system is being implemented, the Hoosier Burger system requiers the development of several forms and reports. You readily identify the dnne for a Delivery Customer order Form. The Delivery Customer Order Form will capture order details for those customers placing delicry orders.What data will the Delivery Customer Order Form need to collect? Using the design guidelines, design the Delivery Customer Order Form.<b id="right">(15 marks)</b>
