				<li>Assume monetary benefit of an information system of $40000 for the first year and increasing benefits of $ 10000 a year for the next five years (year 1 = 40000, year2 = 50000,......, year6=90000). One time development cost were $ 60000 and recurring costs were 3000 over the duration of the systems life. The discount rate the company was 15%. Using six year horizon, calculate the net present value of those costs and benefits. Also calculate the ROI and then present a break even analysis.

				<li>Consider the university registration system. The system should enable staff of each academic department ot examine the modules offered by their department, add and remove modules, and change the information about them (e.g. the maximum number of students permitted). It should permit student ot examine currently available modules, add and drop modules to and from their schedules, and examine the modules for which they are enrolled. Department staff should be able to print a variety of reports about the modules and the students enrolled in them. The system should ensure that no students take too many mdules and theat studnets who have any unpaid fees are not permitted to register (student can verify their fee paying status). Note: assume that a fees data store is maintained by the university's financial office and this data store is accessed by the registration system but the fees data store is not modified by the registration system.

				<li>A restaurant chain has several store locations in a city (with a name and zip code stored for each), and each is managed by one manager. Managers manage only one store. Each restaurant location has its own unique set of menus. Most have more than one menu (e.g., lunch and dinner menas). Each menu has many menu items, and items can appear on multiple menus, and with different prices on different menus. Represent this situation of restaurants with an <b>E-R diagram
