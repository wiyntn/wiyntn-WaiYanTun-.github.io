		<br>
		In 2002, Willliam Kamkwamba had to drop out of school, as his father, a maize and tobacco farmar, could no longer afford his school fees. But despite this setback, William was determined to get his education. He began visiting a local library that had just opened in his old primary school, where he discovered a tattereed science book. With only a rudimentary grasp of English, he taught hiimself basic physics-mainly by studying photos and diagrams. Another book he found there featured windmills on the cover and inspired him  to try and build his own.<br>
		He started by constructing a small model. Then, with the help of a cousin and friend, he spent many weeks searching scrap yards and found old tractor fans, shock absorbers, plastic pipe and bycycle parts, which he used to build the real thing.<br>
		Wha he had built was a crude machine that produced 12 volts and powered four lignts.He eventually replaced the tower with a sturdier one that stands 39 feet, and built a second meachine that watered a family garden.<br>
		The windmill brought William Kamkwamba instant local fame, but despite his accomplishment, he was still unable to returen to school.However, news of his magetsi a mphepo-elecric wind-spread beyond Malawi daily Mail caught the attention of bloggers, which in turn caught the attention of organisers for the Technology Entertainment and Design conference.<br>
		In 2007, William spoke at the TED Global conference in Tanzania and got a standing ovation. Businessmen stepped forward with offers to fund his education and projects, and with money donated by them, he was able to put his cousin and several friends back into school and pay for some decical needs of this family. With the donation, he also drilled a borehole for a well and water pump in his village and installed drip irrigation in his father's fields.<br>
		The Water pump has allowed his family to expand its crops. They have abandoned tobacco and now grow maie, benas, soybenas, potatoes and penauts.The windmills have also gbrought big lifestyle and health cnges to the other villagers.The village has changed a lot/William says. "Now, the time that the would have spent going to fetch water, they are using for doing other things.And also the water they are drinking is clean water, so there is less disease." The villagers have also stopped using kerosene and can use the money previously spent on fuel to buy other things.<br>
		William Kamkwamba's example has inspired other childeren in the village to purseue science. William says they now see that if they put their mind to something, they can achieve it. It has changed the way people think/he says.
